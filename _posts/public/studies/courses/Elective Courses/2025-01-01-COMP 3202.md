## Machine Learning for Predictive Data Analytics

### What is Predictive Data Analytics?

Predictive data analytics is the art of building and using models that make predictions based on patterns extracted from historical data. Applications of predictive data analytics include:

 - <details>
    <summary>Price Prediction</summary>
        Predicting future prices of products or services based on historical data and trends.
    </details>
 - <details>
    <summary>Dosage Prediction</summary>
        Determining the correct dosage of medication or treatment for specific conditions or populations.
    </details>
 - <details>
    <summary>Risk Assessment</summary>
        Evaluating the likelihood of future events or outcomes, often in finance, healthcare, or insurance.
    </details>
 - <details>
    <summary>Propensity Modeling</summary>
        Identifying the likelihood of a customer or user exhibiting a particular behavior, such as purchasing a product.
    </details>
 - <details>
    <summary>Diagnosis</summary>
        The identification of diseases or conditions based on symptoms, test results, or patient data.
    </details>
 - <details>
    <summary>Document Classification</summary>
        Categorizing documents into predefined categories or classes using text analysis techniques.
    </details>

### What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is defined as an automated process that extracts patterns from data.

To build the models used in predictive data analytics applications, we use supervised machine learning. Supervised machine learning techniques automatically learn a model of the relationship between a set of descriptive features and a target feature based on a set of historical examples, or instances. We can then use this model to make predictions for new instances. These two separate steps are shown below:

#### Step One

<div style="text-align: center;">Learning a model from a set of historical instances (Using machine learning to induce a prediction model from a
training dataset)</div>
