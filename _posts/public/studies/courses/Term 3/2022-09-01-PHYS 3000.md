title: "PHYS 3000 - Physics of Device Materials"
description: "PHYS 3000 is an introduction to the physics of materials, particularly group IV and III-V semiconductors, used in common technological devices. It covers fundamental concepts including structures of crystalline solids, quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics of charge carriers, equilibrium charge carrier concentrations, carrier transport, and excess carrier phenomena. These concepts are applied to multi-material devices including pn and metal-semiconductor junctions, metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors, photovoltaic devices, light-emitting diodes, and solid-state lasers."
